FiLo System


Everyday, hundreds and thousands of valuable items are lost from home, trains, and airports etc.
Many of those lost items are never returned to their owners because it is just very difficult to link a lost
item to the owner. This proposed solution is a Find-the-Lost website called FiLo
system. The system could provide a lost item database so that users could check the lost items there
and could add new items they found into it.
